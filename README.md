# Laboratory Exam: Python Fundamentals

## Instructions

### 1. Prepare Your Workspace
- Use Python (IDLE / Jupyter Notebook / VS Code).
- Create a folder named `LabExam_Python_<YourLastName>`  
  _Example:_ `LabExam_Python_DelaCruz`

---

## Programming Task
Create one Python program named `lab_exam.py`. Your program should integrate all topics:

### Step 1 — Program Introduction (Introduction to Python)
- Display a welcome message using `print()`.

### Step 2 — Variables (Variables in Python)
- Store your name (`str`), age (`int`), and GPA (`float`) in variables.

### Step 3 — Data Types (Types in Python)
- Use `type()` to display the data type of each variable.

### Step 4 — Type Conversion (Type Conversion in Python)
- Ask the user for their age as input (string).
- Convert it into an integer.
- Add 5 years and display the new age.

### Step 5 — Comments (Comments in Python)
- Add two single-line comments (`#`) and one multi-line comment (`""" """`).

## File Organization
1. Save your program as `lab_exam.py` inside your folder.  
2. Compress the folder into `LabExam_Python_<YourLastName>.zip`.

---

## Google Drive Upload
1. Upload the `.zip` file to your Google Drive.  
2. Set permissions to **Anyone with the link can view**.  
3. Copy the shareable link.

---

## Video Presentation
Prepare a **3–5 minute** video where you:
1. Introduce yourself (Name, Section).  
2. Show your code in your editor and explain each part.  
3. Run the program and demonstrate the output.  
4. Highlight your comments in the code.  
5. Conclude with what you learned.

**Video Format Guidelines**
- Use screen recording (Zoom, OBS, or built-in recorder).  
- File name: `LabExam_Video_<YourLastName>.mp4`  
- Upload to Google Drive in the same folder as your code.

---

## Google Form Submission
- Open this Google Form: [https://forms.gle/QhXRJD7wiKot5A6A7](https://forms.gle/QhXRJD7wiKot5A6A7)  
- Fill in your details.  
- Paste your Google Drive folder link containing both:
  - `LabExam_Python_<YourLastName>.zip`
  - `LabExam_Video_<YourLastName>.mp4`  
- Submit before the deadline.

## Grading Rubric
- Code correctness & functionality — **40%**  
- Proper use of variables, types, conversion, comments — **25%**  
- Video clarity & explanation — **25%**  
- File organization & submission compliance — **10%**
